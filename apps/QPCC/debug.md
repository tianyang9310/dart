To check:

1. A, b, H, h are all correct

2. linear Constraint mEquality -1, 0, 1

3. lower and upper bound for x (1e-9 not for -1e9)

4. initVal are set correct

5. LCP constraint requested accuracy?
 SNOPTB EXIT   0 -- finished successfully
 SNOPTB INFO   3 -- requested accuracy could not be achieved

 SNOPTB EXIT  40 -- terminated after numerical difficulties
 SNOPTB INFO  41 -- current point cannot be improved
 snopt accuracy complimentary constraint: 1e-19 v.s. 1e-10

6. LCP gradient too large such that infeaisble
