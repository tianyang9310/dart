## Pre

Using Mac OS

## Requirements

1. Using quaternion to simulate angular motion of rigid body

2. Implementing colliding contact between different rigid bodies

## Extra Credit

1. try different collision detector, including DARTCollisionDetector, FCLCollisionDetector and BulletCollisionDetector

2. hit 'a' to spawn cube and 'b' to spawn sphere, both of which are guaranteed to have collision-free initial location
