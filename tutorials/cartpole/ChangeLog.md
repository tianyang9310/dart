# Change and debug log

1. remove GLOBAL variable and use dynamic_pointer_cast to dynamic cast pointer

2. assure constants are initialized before used
	
	*. '''Qf.setIdentity()*5''' doesn't make any sense.

3. regard discreteized cost as continuous one, therefore for state cost it should have delta_t term

4. forcefully initiate x to set correct memory useage

5. prove dynamics and dynamics derivative

6. a major bug in backward pass, that is the last Vx and Vxx are not initiated correctly

7. __when using comma initialization, it is required that input all the data. It is not allowed to input one column at each for loop__

	*. Because finite difference method is a general funciton. Basically it handles all kinds of functions. So I use function template

	*. StepDynamics, StepCost, FinalCost have different arguments

	*. Lambda expression is used to encapsulate function and their arguments. Thereafter, pass into finite difference function only a function handle and an argument
	
8. Only first order derivative dynamics is considered

9. Second order finite difference has some problem, it is not accurate and doesn't behavior correctly
